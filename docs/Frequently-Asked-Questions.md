## General

### How do I download card images?
Forge has content downloaders within the app. See [Card Images](Card-Images.md#downloading) for details.

Layout files are in `userDir/preferences/` (`match.xml` and `editor.xml`).

## Development

### How do I contribute?
Forge is written in Java. See the [IntelliJ setup guide](Development/IntelliJ-setup/IntelliJ-setup.md).

You can also contribute card scripts as plain text files - see `forge-gui/res/cardsfolder/`. This is especially helpful during preview seasons.

## Gameplay

### How do I use Flashback or similar external zone abilities?
Click the Lightning Bolt icon in the player panel.

### How do I target a player?
Click on the player's avatar in the Player Panel.

### Where did my mana go?
Check the mana pool icons in the Player Panel. If you tapped lands before your Main Phase, the mana may have emptied. Start casting spells first, then tap for mana.
